OIBSIP_DataAnalyst_Task3 â€“ Wine Quality Prediction

ðŸ“Œ Objective

The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties.
This task was completed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte under the Data Analyst domain.

ðŸ”‘ Steps Performed

Data Import & Exploration

Loaded the wine quality dataset (Red & White wines).

Checked dataset shape, columns, and summary statistics.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and ensured proper data types.

Performed feature scaling/normalization for numerical variables.

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized correlations between wine features (e.g., acidity, alcohol, sulphates).

Identified factors influencing wine quality.

Model Building

Implemented classification models such as:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Trained and tuned models for best performance.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Compared model performance to select the best predictor.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome

Developed a machine learning pipeline for predicting wine quality.

Identified that features like alcohol, sulphates, and acidity strongly influence wine ratings.

Achieved a reliable prediction model with improved accuracy after preprocessing and tuning.
